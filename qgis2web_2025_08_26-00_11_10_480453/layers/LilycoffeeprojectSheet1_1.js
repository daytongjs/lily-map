It's located right on Vine Street in downtown OTR and walking distance from Washington Park and the many restaurants and bars in Over the Rhine. I love the exposed brick and intimate feel of 1215! 1215 has Deeper Roots Coffee, just like many other Cincinnati coffee shops.

It's not the biggest place to stay, but there are a few tables to sit an enjoy your drink. The times that I've visited, it's been pretty quiet inside, majority of people working or reading. It's a quiet coffee shop, but you should definitely know that there isn't any WiFi inside! In the summer, 1848 has a nice patio area outside, perfect to be in the sun and enjoy your coffee. Strong, bold, and bitter are three words I would use to describe 1848. Although I love their coffee black because of how strong their coffee is, if you're not too keen on extremely strong coffee, make sure you order with room for cream! 1848 will not give you a weak cup of coffee, which is fantastic.","Field7":"website","Name_1":"1848 Coffee","City":"New Berlin, WI","Field12":null,"Field13":null,"Field14":null,"Field15":null,"Field16":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-88.1084,42.9764]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Date Visited":"2025/05/29","Name":"Aldo's Coffee Co","Location":"Greenport, NY","Coffee Rating":"9","Cuteness Rating":"5","Overall Review":"Aldo's had wonderfully smooth espresso that was rich and chocolately.

The coffee itself was pretty okay, they served Deeper Roots coffee, which isn't much to write home about. I could definitely taste the coffee, but the syrup itself wasn't very complimentary to the coffee and instead tasted just like a sweeter latte instead of a caramel latte. I think it's because the coffee itself was more on the acidic side and the caramel only balanced out the acidity, not adding flavor.

They travel all over Cincinnati almost daily, so check out their Instagram @blondiebrewsco to see what location they're at every day. I visited when they were stopped at Magnolia Rose, perfect to get both a cup of coffee and flowers! Even in the freezing cold and wind, Blondie Brews is worth the stop! Blondie Brews is known for their specialty lattes, completed with Nutter Butters, Hershey Kisses, Werther's Caramels, and so much more with all of their lattes! Their lattes are 100% the most beautiful and Instagrammable drinks I've gotten in Cincinnati thus far. They have such creative drink combinations, anyone will be able to find something they love! They were just using nespresso pods as the way to provide their espresso, so not the best, but they definitely made it up for by how creative they are in their lattes and other drinks.","Field7":"website","Name_1":"Blondie Brews","City":"Cincinnati, OH","Field12":null,"Field13":null,"Field14":null,"Field15":null,"Field16":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.512,39.1031]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Date Visited":"2024/12/11","Name":"Bowtie Cafe","Location":"Mount Adams, OH","Coffee Rating":"8.1","Cuteness Rating":"6.8","Overall Review":"I feel very calm in here, lots of people working but also some chatters. The atmosphere is more rustic modern, but not too like in your face modern that could stress you out. Coffee is smooth, not very acidic and the americano is almost sweet. Lots of pastries and food and Cierci says that the raspberry croissant is one of the best pastries she's ever had. Avocado toast is pretty good too. The epsresso has the preserved oils at the top which is a good sign for having a good espresso blend and machine. They use monin syrups, but at least they have a limited selection and still have the sauces. Feels almost a little too watered down for my americano though. Overall super great.

Sitting at the cute tables and looking out towards downtown Naples is the perfect way for anyone to start their day. Cafe Marquise had great coffee! Bold, smooth, all things that you'd want in your morning cup of joe. However, my choice is still the chai tea latte because it was that good! I loved the amount of cinnamon they put on top and the chai wasn't too sweet, but not too spicy either. If you want an extra kick, make the drink a dirty chai!

It's a great place to hang out for a while, since they have more of a \"barstyle,\" instead of having an actual register. The several two-person tables and chairs are great to either hang out by yourself or with one other person! Canary Coffee Bar has lots of different blends that are perfect to try. Any one of their blends can be made to order, plus they have full espresso bar options.

There's more of an industrial look to it, but the main atmospheric attraction is their parrot, Sundance! Customers are able to hold him and watch him dance along to the music playing in the shop. I tried their Cincy Signature, which is a traditional Yemeni coffee drink with a more \"muddy\" coffee texture with cardamom and ginger. Although it doesn't have as many sweet undertones as I thought it would have, it's incredibly strong. If you're a strong coffee lover, and want the Yemeni coffee experience, definitely get this.

The modern feel makes the shop not seem very cozy, but instead more industrail and a place that would be a good work from home environment. The service is great, all of the staff is super friendly and helpful. It's not the strongest coffee in the world, and I definitely recommend just getting black coffee to taste the flavors of the coffee itself. The espresso definitely blends in with the flavors and milk that can be added to the different drinks, and isn't something that necessarily shines through to give a distinct coffee taste. This is why I'd recommend going for a black coffee or americano when visiting Cinergy, so you can taste the nutty flavors of the espresso itself.","Field7":"website","Name_1":"Cinergy Cafe","City":"Deer Park, OH","Field12":null,"Field13":null,"Field14":null,"Field15":null,"Field16":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.3947,39.2056]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Date Visited":"2024/11/29","Name":"Coffee Amici","Location":"Findlay, OH","Coffee Rating":"4","Cuteness Rating":"6","Overall Review":"Very cozy vibes but just the super basic tables and church basement chairs.

Almost every seat is full with people working on laptops, even though there is lots of seating within the shop. Sitwell's has very \"livingroom\" vibes, with mix-matched chairs and tables. There's also lots of art made by local artists, and it's a very warm environment to be in. A great spot to get comfortable and get some work done! Strong, bold, flavorful, delicious! All words I'm using to describe Sitwell's Coffee. I got a hot americano, my go-to for trying new places, and this is one of the most flavorful and strong americanos that I've had. Their espresso blend clearly uses a darker roast, since there is not a hint of acidity, but instead extremely smooth and with very oaky and cedar notes embedded in the blend. I talked to one of the baristas, who said that their dark roast drip coffee is very popular as well. I'm assuming that their lattes aren't too special besides their espresso blend, since they use Monin syryps, as do many coffee shops in the area. Go for the black coffees!","Field7":"website","Name_1":"Sitwell's Coffeehouse","City":"Clifton, Cincy","Field12":null,"Field13":null,"Field14":null,"Field15":null,"Field16":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.5206,39.133]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Date Visited":"2024/07/16","Name":"Southdown Coffee","Location":"Newport, NY","Coffee Rating":"6","Cuteness Rating":"5.4","Overall Review":"Just a little walk in and not much seating inside.

They roast their own beans and have their own coffee that they sell. Their latte was smooth and they make their own syrups as well. I got a pumpkin latte, so different than what I've usually gotten at previous coffee shops. Strong pumpkin taste, but also very present coffee taste! Smooth, and super tasty. If there was a stronger coffee taste, then it would be a 10/10, but it was still absolutely amazing. The place itself was also super cute! Modern, with exposed brick and very, very cute!

When you walk in, the aroma puts you in such a great coffee mood. My favorite part of Stauf's is the courtyard, especially since when I had visited, it was a great, warm day! The German Village shop is the perfect location, especially for book lovers! Be sure to stop into Book Loft if you visit, which is right next door. I knew that it was going to be a good cup of coffee when I saw all of the preserved oils on top of my drink. The oils are where the flavors are in the coffee, and Stauf's has very flavorful espresso.

However, it depends on the location on whether or not the cafe is a more of a working environment coffee shop or more social. I recommend the Wauwautosa location if you're wanting to get some studying in, but the Factory Cafe downtown if you want to hang out with friends! No matter what, you can never go wrong with Stone Creek! Stone Creek Coffee is another Milwaukee staple! Each one of their drinks are perfectly crafted and no matter what drink you choose, the coffee will taste fantastic. If you go to the downtown location, the beans are freshly roasted in house, ensuring that your coffee will be as fresh as possible. Stone Creek Coffee is strong, and I recommend going for their dark roast or espresso roast, because their lighter roasts tend to be extremely bitter.

It has a very homey feel to it, with art created by local artists lining the wall. I definitely think that it's a place where the culture is a place to get work done and study, especially since it's open much longer than many other coffee shops in the area. There's a ton of seating both downstairs and upstairs, and is probably one of the cutest shops I've been to. The 86 is in between University of Cincinnati and Short Vine, so it's a happening place to be! The 86 has their beans roasted in house by Pnemua Coffee Roasters, which makes it so all of their coffee is extremely fresh. I personally thought that their espresso was a little too bitter just by itself, so I'd recommend getting getting a flavored latte or cappuccino to balance out the bitterness to it.","Field7":"website","Name_1":"The 86","City":"Corryville, Cincy","Field12":null,"Field13":null,"Field14":null,"Field15":null,"Field16":null},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-84.5093,39.1306]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"Date Visited":"2025/05/30","Name":"The Barn- Merrick","Location":"Merrick, NY","Coffee Rating":"6","Cuteness Rating":"5","Overall Review":"The Barn is such a unique spot to grab a sweet treat, and sweet it was!

I got the Reese's Overload iced latte, which was super sweet and almost tasted like a milkshake. I'd recommend The Barn for a treat, not as much as a daily cup of coffee, but it's still a place you don't want to miss! All of the staff was very kind and helpful when I had any questions, and it's a wonderful environment to be apart of, even though it's just a drive thru coffee shop and you can't go inside.
